     * Pig latin works as follows: every word has its first character moved to the end, and 'ay' is added to the end of the
     * word.
     *
     *     example:
     *     word = ordway
     *     pig = igpay
     *     latin = atinlay
     *
     * Take in a word and return the pig latin form. You will need to use the substring method of String to break
     * up the string.
     * String docs: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html

     * @param in A string.
     * @return the pig latin form of in.
